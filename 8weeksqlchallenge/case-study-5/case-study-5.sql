/* ************************************************* 1. Data Cleansing Steps*/
/*========================================================================*/
/*
 In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
 Convert the week_date to a DATE format
 Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
 Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
 Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
 Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
 segment	age_band
 1	Young Adults
 2	Middle Aged
 3 or 4	Retirees
 
 Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
 segment	demographic
 C	Couples
 F	Families
 
 Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
 Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

  /* ************************************************* 2. Data Exploration*/
  /*========================================================================*/
  -- 1 - What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
  /*========================================================================*/
  -- 2 - What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
  /*========================================================================*/
  -- 3 - How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
  /*========================================================================*/
  -- 4 - What is the total sales for each region for each month?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 5 - What is the total count of transactions for each platform
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 6 - What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 7 - What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 8 - Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 9 - Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
  /* ************************************************* 3. Before & After Analysis*/
  /* This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.
   Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.
   We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
   Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:*/
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 1 - What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 2 - What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
  /*======================================================================== */
  -- 3 - How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?
  /* ************************************************* 4. Bonus Question*/
  /* Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?
   
   region
   platform
   age_band
   demographic
   customer_type
   Do you have any further recommendations for Dannyâ€™s team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?*/
